Assignment: Write a program that will determine the type of a triangle.  

• It should take the lengths of the triangle's three sides as input, and return whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
• We are looking for solutions that showcase problem solving skills and structural considerations that can be applied to larger and potentially more complex problem domains. 
• Pay special attention to tests, readability of code and error cases
• The solution must be implemented in Java
• You are expected to spend 2-5 hours on the task 

The resulting code and especially the discussion of the code at the interview is important to us. We use it to validate your engineering skills.
